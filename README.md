# Run2Win

Run2Win is an engaging and interactive platformer C++ game that features diverse environments, dynamic characters, and challenging obstacles. Designed with fun and interactivity in mind, it provides players with a rich gaming experience complete with power-ups, hostile elements, and customizable game settings. The game is built using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphics and audio, and includes a level design interface that allows players to create and customize their own levels. With multiple characters to choose from, each with unique abilities and unlockable through in-game coins, Run2Win offers a variety of gameplay options to keep players entertained and challenged.

## Features

- **Multiple Characters**: Choose from four unique characters, each unlockable through in-game coins.
- **Interactive Physics**: Experience varying physics across different terrains such as ice, where deceleration is noticeably slower, adding to the challenge and realism.
- **Level Design Interface**: A user-friendly menu system allows players to design and customize levels. Create your own obstacles, enemies, and power-ups to challenge friends and family.

- **Sound Effects and Music**: Rich audio effects enhance the gameplay, with adjustable settings to tailor sound levels.
- **Help and Support**: Access the help menu from both the interface and within the game to better understand game mechanics and features.
